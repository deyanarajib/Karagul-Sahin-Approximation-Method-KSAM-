Karagul-Sahin's Algorithm
1. Calculate the rij (pdm) amd rji (psm) values for matrix A (wcd) and B (wcs)
2. Calculate the weighted transportation cost matrix by multiplying the rates and the cost values and form A (wcd) and B (wcs) matrices.
3. To start with the smallest weighted costs in the matrices wcd and wcs, make assignments taking into account the demand and supply constraints.
4. If all demand are met, finish the algorithm. Otherwise, go back to Step 3.
5. Compare the solution values of assignments matrices. Set the smaller solution as the initial solution.
